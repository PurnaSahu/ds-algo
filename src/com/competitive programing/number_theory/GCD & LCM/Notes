How to find GCD of two numbers?
 	few properties;
 	GCD (a, 1)= GCD (1, b)= 1
 	GCD (a, 0)= a, a>0
 	GCD (a, b)<= min (a, b) -> this property is going to help in making the logic
 	GCD (a, a)= a 

there are 3 approaches;

 	a. Pduedo Code:
 		GCD(a,b) -> assume a>b, so i'm taking the minimum from both & start iterating downward from the minimum nuber
 		for (int i=b to 1){
 			we will find the number which divides both a & b, whenver we find that number, stop there, thats our biggest number which divides both a&b
 			if (a%i==0 && b%i==0){
 				gcd= i;
 				break;
 			}
 		}
 		Time Complexity = O(min(a, b))
 	
 	b. another property: This algorithm is called Eucledian Algorithm
 		GCD(a,b)= GCD (a-b, b) where a>=b
